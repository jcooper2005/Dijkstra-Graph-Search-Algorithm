Dijkstra.py is a parallel implementation of the Dijkstra graph search algorithm.  It's useful for finding the lowest cost path between two points.  The source file also includes a data generation function that produces random graph data, including verticies, edges and costs.

There are a few configurations you can set inside the source file, which are commented for you. Once you're ready, run the program with python Dijkstra.py
